<h1>Welcome To A Game of Tic-Tac-Toe!</h1>

<!-- Before you even start working with JavaScript, construct the gameboard. 
The gameboard page should include the 3x3 grid (of divs), and at minimum a reset button. 
Using id and/or class on clickable elements will help you wire this up in JavaScript afterwards. -->


<!-- Create a div for the gameboard -->

<div id='container'>
        <div class ='grid' id="0"></div>
        <div class ='grid' id="1"></div>
        <div class ='grid' id="2"></div>
        <div class ='grid' id="3"></div>
        <div class ='grid' id="4"></div>
        <div class ='grid' id="5"></div>
        <div class ='grid' id="6"></div>
        <div class ='grid' id="7"></div>
        <div class ='grid' id="8"></div> 
        
        <div>
            <div id ='turnMessage'>Player 1 please make your move</p>
        </div>
        <div>
        <div id ='result'></div>
        <div id ='tieGame'></div>
        <button onClick ='window.location.reload();' id='resetTheGame'>Ok, new game!</button>
        </div>

<!-- display message indicating who turn is it  -->
<!-- generate button that will reset the game -->

<!-- A user should be able to click on different squares to make a move.
Every click will alternate between marking an X and O
Upon marking of an individual cell, use JavaScript to add an X or O to the cell, according to whose turn it is.
A cell should not be able to be replayed once marked.
You should not be able to click remaining empty cells after the game is over.
Add a reset button that will clear the contents of the board.
Display a message to indicate which turn is about to be played.
Detect draw conditions (ties/cat's game)
Detect winner: Stop game and declare the winner if one player ends up getting three in a row.
Hint: Determine a set of winning combinations. Check those combinations on the board contents after every move. -->-
